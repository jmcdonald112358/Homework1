# Homework1
Homework for bootcamp week 1

----------------------------

This project involved taking an existing, functional website for an SEO company and refactoring the code to utilize semantic tags and restructured CSS for an improved codebase that's easier for future devs to navigate and work on, plus improved accessibility attributes and relevant commenting of changes that were made in these simplification efforts.
